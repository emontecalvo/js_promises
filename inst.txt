In the spotify.js file there are two functions. The getFromApi function uses the fetch API to make requests to the Spotify API. It returns a promise, which you can add a .then call to.

You will be responsible for filling in the getArtist function. Update this function to:

Make a call to the search endpoint using the getFromApi function.

The query parameter should contain the following information:

{
    q: name,
    limit: 1,
    type: 'artist'
}
Use .then to add a callback which will run when getFromApi resolves.

Inside the callback you should:
Set the artist global to be equal to item.artists.items[0], where item is the information obtained from the API (which will be passed as the first argument to your callback).
Return the artist object.
Return the promise which you created by calling getFromApi.
Open up index.html and try running a search. You should see that an artist who matches your search term is added below the search bar.
